# Welcome 👋 to AusOpenTech

Here in Australia, the complete exclusion of Australians with technical knowledge from decision-making and development of public technology is so normalised that the minister in charge of digital transformation can get away with rebranding code from Singapore as a “sovereign Australian app” and [redirecting blame at Google and Apple](https://www.zdnet.com/article/minister-still-blaming-covidsafe-flaws-on-apple-and-google/) COVIDSafe [didn’t work when Australians needed it](https://ghuntley.com/covidsafe/).
 
There is nothing natural or universal about the exclusion of people with technical knowledge from decisions about and _development of_ government tech. In Switzerland, when members of this community discovered [a serious cryptographic problem](https://openprivacy.ca/assets/how-not-to-prove-your-election-outcome-preprint.pdf) in their e-voting system, the Federal Chancellery funded us and Swiss experts to collaborate on an [open, in-depth reassessment of the entire program](https://www.bk.admin.ch/bk/en/home/politische-rechte/e-voting/berichte-und-studien.html). The NSW iVote system had the same bugs, but there was no serious reassessment and there is no plan to change their approach.

Inspired by Taiwan’s [Sunflower movement](https://g0v.tw/manifesto/en/) we are a community of Aussies who want to change the status quo, a collective of people pushes for better technology policy and practices across Australia’s public sector.
